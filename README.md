# 🚮 TrashTrack

## 1. Project Title  
**TrashTrack** – Community-Driven Garbage Reporting & District Cleanliness Tracker  

---

## 2. Description  
TrashTrack is a web application that allows citizens to **report garbage spots** in their locality by uploading a picture and selecting the location on an interactive map.  

🌍 Why it matters:  
- Overflowing garbage bins and illegal dumping are major urban problems in India.  
- Municipalities struggle due to lack of **real-time data**.  
- Citizens don’t have a simple, transparent way to report and track garbage issues.  

👥 Target users:  
- General public (to report garbage)  
- Municipal authorities (to act on reports)  
- NGOs / Cleanliness drives (to identify hotspots)
